## Call to Action

This roadmap is ambitious but achievable. Each phase delivers value while
building toward the vision of an AI-augmented desktop environment.

**Current Focus**: Complete Phase 0 to establish a solid foundation.

**Next Steps**:

1. Implement component library
2. Build configuration system
3. Create workspace module
4. Add clock module
5. Test and iterate

The journey from a simple bar to an intelligent desktop environment starts with
a single QML file. Let's build the future of human-computer interaction, one
module at a time.
